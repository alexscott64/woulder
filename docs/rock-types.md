# Rock Type Drying Times and Characteristics

## Scientific Research Summary

Rock drying times are influenced by:
1. **Porosity**: Higher porosity = slower drying (water absorbed into rock)
2. **Grain size**: Fine-grained rocks retain water longer
3. **Surface texture**: Rough surfaces hold water droplets longer
4. **Thermal properties**: Heat retention affects evaporation rate

## Rock Type Classifications

### Wet-Sensitive Rocks (DO NOT CLIMB WHEN WET)
These rocks are permanently damaged when climbed wet:

1. **Sandstone** (Arkose, Graywacke)
   - Porosity: 10-35%
   - Drying time: 24-72 hours after rain
   - **CRITICAL**: Soft, absorbs water deeply, holds become friable when wet
   - Climbing when wet causes permanent erosion and hold breakage
   - Requires at least 24-48 hours dry weather + good drying conditions

### Fast-Drying Rocks (4-12 hours)
Non-porous, hard crystalline rocks:

1. **Granite** (including Granodiorite)
   - Porosity: 0.5-1.5%
   - Drying time: 4-8 hours in good conditions
   - Surface dries quickly, minimal water absorption
   - Examples: Squamish, Leavenworth, Gold Bar, Paradise, Treasury

2. **Tonalite**
   - Porosity: 0.5-2%
   - Drying time: 4-8 hours
   - Similar to granite, slightly more feldspars
   - Examples: Black Mountain, Tramway

3. **Rhyolite**
   - Porosity: 5-10% (volcanic, but fine-grained)
   - Drying time: 6-10 hours
   - Glassy texture sheds water well
   - Example: Happy/Sad Boulders

### Medium-Drying Rocks (8-16 hours)

1. **Basalt / Andesite**
   - Porosity: 2-10%
   - Drying time: 8-12 hours
   - Volcanic, can have vesicles that trap water
   - Example: Money Creek (andesite basalt)

2. **Schist**
   - Porosity: 2-5%
   - Drying time: 8-14 hours
   - Foliated, water can seep between layers
   - Example: Icicle Creek

### Slow-Drying Rocks (16-36 hours)

1. **Phyllite**
   - Porosity: 5-15%
   - Drying time: 16-24 hours
   - Fine-grained metamorphic, holds moisture in layers
   - Examples: Money Creek, Calendar Butte

2. **Argillite**
   - Porosity: 5-20%
   - Drying time: 18-30 hours
   - Clay-rich, absorbs and retains water
   - Example: Calendar Butte

3. **Chert / Metavolcanic**
   - Porosity: 1-5%
   - Drying time: 12-18 hours
   - Dense but can have micro-pores
   - Example: Money Creek

## Drying Time Modifiers

### Environmental Factors:
- **Temperature > 65°F**: -20% drying time
- **Temperature 55-65°F**: baseline
- **Temperature < 55°F**: +30% drying time
- **Sun exposure**: -25% drying time
- **Wind 5-15 mph**: -20% drying time
- **Humidity < 50%**: -15% drying time
- **Humidity > 70%**: +25% drying time

### Precipitation Amount:
- Light rain (< 0.1"): Use base drying time
- Moderate rain (0.1-0.3"): +50% drying time
- Heavy rain (> 0.3"): +100% drying time

## Warning System

1. **Critical (Red)**: Wet-sensitive rock + wet/recent rain → "DO NOT CLIMB"
2. **Poor (Red)**: Rock still wet, not safe to climb
3. **Fair (Yellow)**: Rock drying but may still be damp
4. **Good (Green)**: Rock is dry and safe to climb
